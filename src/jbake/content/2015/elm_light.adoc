== Background
I've just started playing around a little bit with http://elm-lang.org/[elm].
This weekend I'm going to http://www.codemesh.io/[codemesh] where I'll be attending an Elm workshop
with the author of Elm, Evan Czaplicki.

To ensure I have an editor I'm familiar with and to get me started a little, I figured I'd create an Elm language plugin
for Light Table. However lately I've been a little busy helping out  getting https://github.com/LightTable/LightTable version 0.8
released. Last weekend we got an 0.8 alpha out. I needed some of the features from Electron. So now with Light Table using
Electron under the hoods I could finally complete an intial plugin release. It's rough, but it's an ok start I suppose !
