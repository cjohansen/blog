Wow! Implementing my own paredit plugin for Light Table. How (and why) on earth did I end up doing that ?


== Introduction
A few months back I set forth on a mission trying to bring some proper Clojure refactoring support to Light Table through
the https://github.com/rundis/clj-light-refactor/[clj-light-refactor] plugin. One of the first features I implemented
was a http://rundis.github.io/blog/2015/clj_light_thread.html[threading refactoring] using clojure.zip and cljs.reader.
It quickly became evident that both clojure.zip and cljs.reader put severe limitations on what I would be able to implement.
The reader is quite limited in terms of the syntaz it allows and using a plain zipper would make it incredibly tedious in terms of
handling formatting (whitespace, newlines and comments etc).

The experience of using a zipper for refactoring was really appealing to me, but I needed something way better to be able
to do anything really useful. I put the whole thing on the backburner for a while, until I stumbled upon
https://github.com/xsc/rewrite-clj/[rewrite-clj]. It looked like just the thing I needed, however it had no ClojureScript
support though. After weeks of deliberation I decided to write a ClojureScript port, aptly named https://github.com/rundis/rewrite-cljs[rewrite-cljs].

The ParEdit support in Light Table is somewhat limited, a few plugins to remedy that has been implemented none of which
are actively maintained or easily extendable. They all focus on the editor, text and moving braces around.


Could I make something a lot more structured for Light Table, where the focus is on navigating and moving proper clojure code nodes in a virtual AST ?
If Light Table falls over and dies, will all my efforts have been in vain ?


TIP: Well I present to you https://github.com/rundis/parembrace[**parembrace**] a slightly different take on implementing
a paredit plugin for Light Table using rewrite-cljs for most of it's heavy lifting

== Implementation challenges


=== A more powerful reader
My first challenge was that the default reader in ClojureScript, cljs.reader, only supports a subset of
of valid clojure code. Things like anonymous functions and other reader macros are not supported.
I had to address that before I could even consider trying to do a port of rewrite-clj.

Luckily I found most of what I needed in the https://github.com/lazerwalker/clojurescript-in-clojurescript[clojurescript-in-clojurescript] project.
It even supported a IndexingPUshBackReader which was essential for retaining source positional information about the nodes in a zipper.
I had to hack around it a little bit, but nearly everything I needed was in place. Yay !

NOTE: I ended up bundling the modded reader in rewrite-cljs btw.


=== Porting rewrite-clj
I won't bore you with the details here, but it was mostly pretty straight forward. While I was at it, I opted
for extending its' features somewhat:

- I added bounds meta information for all nodes (start - end coordinates)
- Finder functions to locate nodes by a given position in the underlying source
- A paredit namespace

NOTE: The paredit namespace should probably be factored out to a separate lib. I really shouldn't  bloat rewrite-cljs unnecessarily.

Whan creating(/aka porting) rewrite-cljs my intention was always to ensure that it was reusable from many other contexts than
my own client libs/apps. Whether I've succeeded with that I guess is yet to be proven !

It's used from parembrace and clj-light-refactor, but I see no reason why you wouldn't be able to reuse it
from say the Atom editor or your somewhat overly ambitious fully structural ClojureScript SPA editor project.


=== Performance
It quickly became evident that parsing all code in an editor to a rewrite-cljs zipper structure
for every paredit editor action wouldn't be usable for files beyond 100-200 lines of code.
For now I have to settle for the inconvenience of working within the context of top level forms.
Having used the plugin during it's development for a couple of weeks now, that's not really a problem
99 % if the time (at least for me that is).




== A smattering of code

Let me run you through an example. Paredit raise-sexpr

[source,clojure]
----
(dynamic-wind in (lambda () |body) out) ; ->
(dynamic-wind in |body out) ; ->
body
----


=== rewrite-cljs

[source,clojure]
----
(defn raise [zloc]                               // <1>
  (if-let [containing (z/up zloc)]
    (z/replace containing (z/node zloc))         // <2>
    zloc))                                       // <3>
----
<1> zloc is a the zipper node we wish to raise. From the example above the body token node
<2> If zloc has a parent node (seq), then we replace the parent node with the node at zloc
<3> If zloc has no parent, we can't raise we just return zloc


.Trying it out
[source, clojure]
----
(ns foo-bar
  (:require [rewrite-clj.zip :as z]
            [rewrite-clj.paredit :as pe])

(-> (z/of-string "(dynamic-wind in (lambda () body) out)")    // <1>
    (pe/find-by-pos {:row 1 :col 29})                         // <2>
    pe/raise                                                  // <3>
    pe/raise
    z/root-string)                                            // <4>
----
<1> Create a clojure zipper with rewrite nodes for the initial code
<2> Locate zloc, a pointer to the **body** node in our instance
<3> Raise (twice to produce the end result)
<4> Wrap up the zipper and return it's stringified representation


=== Light Table

The generic function for invoking paredit commands in parembrace looks something like the this:
[source,clojure]
----
(defn paredit-cmd [ed f]
  (let [pos (editor/->cursor ed)
        form (u/get-top-level-form ed)                                         // <1>
        zloc (positioned-zip pos form)]                                        // <2>
    (when zloc
      (editor/replace ed (:start form) (:end form) (-> zloc f z/root-string))  // <3>
      (editor/move-cursor ed pos)                                              // <4>
      (format-keep-pos ed))))                                                  // <5>

----

<1> Get the top-level form at given position
<2> Given form an position in LT terms, create a zipper and position it at node with given position
<3> Replace the form in editor with the rewritten form after applying paredit/zipper function **f**
<4> The positioning isn't quite as trivial as this with depth changing commands
<5> Format the form nicely

[TIP]
====
For raise, f would in our example be a reference to `pe/raise`, but really it could be
something really whacky like :
[source,clojure]
----
#(-> % pe/raise pe/kill z/leftmost)
----

which would given you:
[source,clojure]
----
(|dynamic-wind in)
----

Let me know if that is something you would find useful icon:smile-o[role="green"]
====


.Behaviors and commands
[source, clojure]
----
(behavior ::raise!                                                   // <1>
          :triggers #{:parembrace.raise!}
          :reaction (fn [ed]
                      (paredit-cmd ed pe/raise)))



(cmd/command {:command :parembrace.raise                             // <2>
              :desc "Parembrace: Raise"
              :exec (fn []
                      (when-let [ed (pool/last-active)]
                        (object/raise ed :parembrace.raise!)))})
----
<1> The behavior here strictly speaking isn't needed, but it provides a means to scope the feature
to only be available for editors tagged as clojure editors
<2> The commands are there for you to be able to either execute from the command bar, or for mapping a keyboard shortcut



== Current state and future plans for Parembrace ?
A large percentage of the features in the http://pub.gajendra.net/src/paredit-refcard.pdf[paredit reference card] has been
implemented. Some features behave slightly different, and there are a couple of novel nuggets there as well.
All is not well though. Cursor positioning needs improving and performance needs to be tweaked.

What does the future hold ? Well I'm planning on implementing the missing features and I'm sure I'll add a few more
useful nuggets too. The most important thing I aim to provide is a clear pluggable way of extending and modifying features
to allow you to customize parembrace to your liking.



== Conclusion
I believe rewrite-cljs already has paid off multiple times. I can't thank https://github.com/xsc[xsc] enough
for writing https://github.com/xsc/rewrite-clj/[rewrite-clj]. It's really awesome and without it I'd still be fumbling around with parsers and what-not.
I can reuse rewrite-cljs from both parembrace and clj-light-refactor. In the latter not only can I start implementing cool code refactoring features, but
I can do things like structurally traverse and  rewrite the project.clj file. I can't wait to get started... well I have to wait because I'm moving to a new house, but after that...
